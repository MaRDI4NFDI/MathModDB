<b>Motivation</b>
<br>
Proper documentation and storage of research data, adhering to FAIR principles, are crucial for reproducibility and scientific integrity.
Applied mathematics, producing diverse numerical and symbolic data, heavily relies on models that must be well-documented for replication and future use.
Here, we present MathModDB, an ontology for mathematical models, along with a knowledge graph containing over xxxxx elements.
